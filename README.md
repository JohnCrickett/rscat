 Rust solution to Coding Challenges [build your own cat](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cat)

## Step 0
Grabbing some test data.

```bash
curl "https://dummyjson.com/quotes?limit=10" | jq '.quotes | .[] | .quote' > test.txt
curl "https://dummyjson.com/quotes?limit=10&skip=10" | jq '.quotes | .[] | .quote' > test2.txt
```

## Step 1

```bash
cargo build -r
./target/release/rscat ./test.txt

```

## Step 2
```bash
cargo build -r
head -n1 test.txt | ./target/release/rscat - 
"Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths."
```

## Step 3
```bash
cargo build -r
./target/release/rscat test.txt test2.txt
"Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths."
"The Bay of Bengal is hit frequently by cyclones. The months of November and May, in particular, are dangerous in this regard."
"Thinking is the capital, Enterprise is the way, Hard Work is the solution."
"If You Can'T Make It Good, At Least Make It Look Good."
"Heart be brave. If you cannot be brave, just go. Love's glory is not a small thing."

```

## Step 4
For step 4, add clap as a dependency:
```bash
cargo add clap --features derive
```

```bash
cargo build -r && head -n3 test.txt | ./target/release/rscat -n
1 "Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths."
2 "The Bay of Bengal is hit frequently by cyclones. The months of November and May, in particular, are dangerous in this regard."
3 "Thinking is the capital, Enterprise is the way, Hard Work is the solution."
```

## Step 5
```bash
Step 5
sed G test.txt | ./target/release/rscat -n | head -n4
1 "Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths."
2 
3 "The Bay of Bengal is hit frequently by cyclones. The months of November and May, in particular, are dangerous in this regard."
4 
```

```bash
sed G test.txt | ./target/release/rscat -b | head -n4
